In The Netherlands, to do the high-school mathematics exam, you need a graphing calculator, and one that many people use is the [Casio fx-CG50](https://www.casio.com/intl/scientific-calculators/product.FX-CG50/). On this calculator, you can execute custom programs written in Casio BASIC, and I decided to take the opportunity to write some simple games. The list of games is:
- Snake (see video below)
- Pong for two players
- Tic-tac-toe
