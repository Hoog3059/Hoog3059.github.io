Hello!

I'm currently in the third year of my BSc Applied Physics at [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl). I have a strong interest in physics, as well as practical applications.

In my free time I occasionally like to work on personal projects, which you can find [here](./projects/). You can also find some university projects here.
